This document is a solutions manual to accompany <b>James, G., Witten, D., Hastie, T., and Tibshirani, R. [<i>An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R</i> (2nd ed.).](https://www.statlearning.com/)</b> Springer, 2021.

All solutions are based on the authors' definitions, assuming that all theorems, including lemmas and corollaries, and examples covered in the text can be cited without proof.
If one quotes a proposition introduced in another exercise, see the solution to that problem for proof.

This paper is unofficial and might still contain some errors, although I have worked on minimizing them.
You can contribute to it via my [email](mailto:mgklee@kaist.ac.kr). All reports and suggestions are welcome.
